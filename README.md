# EzyStocks Backend

The EzyStocks Backend is a Spring Boot application with a PostgreSQL database that handles stocks buying, selling and portfolio management. This repository powers the mobile application built using Flutter, providing seamless communication and real-time updates between the app and the backend.

### My Role:
I played a significant role in implementing the backend services, including User Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). I developed the authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT for secure session management and implemented detailed RBAC to restrict access based on user roles. I also integrated the backend with a PostgreSQL database to store user and stocks data.

### Key Features:
- User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and logout processes using JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management. Passwords are securely hashed and stored, ensuring strong protection against unauthorized access.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator), and access to specific resources or endpoints is granted based on these roles.
  - Admin users have full access to all endpoints, while User and Moderator roles have restricted access based on permissions.

- Authorization:
  - Access control mechanisms ensure that only users with the correct roles can perform actions or access specific resources. Unauthorized users receive **Access Denied** responses for restricted endpoints.

- JWT Authentication:
  - Used for stateless user sessions across API requests. Tokens are issued after successful login and are required to access protected endpoints.

- Secure Communication:
  - HTTPS is used for secure communication between the client and server to protect sensitive data during transmission.

- Role Permissions:
  - Detailed permissions are implemented for each role to restrict access to specific API resources.

- Customizable System:
  - The system is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy addition of new roles and permissions without significant changes to the codebase.
